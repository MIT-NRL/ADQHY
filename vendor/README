21.03.13 compiled and linked fine on RHEL7 
(cg1d-dassrv3.ornl.gov).  Any newer SDK complained when linking the IOC
application, complaining of needing GLIBC 3.4.21.  RHEL7 currently
has glibc 2.17.  I decided to use 21.03.13.

To try a different QHYCCD SDK it is simple:
1) go into SDK folder
2) sudo bash distclean.sh (cleans up old SDK)
3) sudo bash install.sh (installs new SDK)
4) rebuild support application /home/controls/epics/qhysupport
5) rebuild IOC /home/controls/cg1d/applications/cg1d-qhy
